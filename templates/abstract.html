    <p> Predicting student performance is a critical focus in educational data mining, aiming to identify students at risk of underachievement and to enhance educational outcomes through targeted interventions. This study investigates the efficacy of various machine learning models in predicting students' academic performance using a diverse set of features, including demographic data, academic records, behavioral indicators, and socio-economic factors. 
        The dataset comprises records from multiple educational institutions, encompassing a broad spectrum of student backgrounds and academic disciplines.
        We employ a range of algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. Feature engineering techniques are applied to optimize the dataset, including normalization, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure a comprehensive understanding of their predictive capabilities.
        Our findings reveal that ensemble methods, particularly random forests and gradient boosting machines, outperform other models in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness. Additionally, feature importance analysis highlights that academic performance is significantly influenced by prior grades, attendance records, and participation in extracurricular activities. Socio-economic factors, while less influential, still contribute to the overall prediction accuracy.
        The study concludes by emphasizing the potential of predictive analytics in education to provide actionable insights for educators and policymakers. By identifying at-risk students early, targeted support programs can be implemented, ultimately improving student retention and success rates.
